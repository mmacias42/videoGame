# videoGame
 My game for class
I made this game in Intro to Programming in Bellarmine 2022... every time i change smoething here it is listening.

# iterative factorial
# for i in range(3):
#     x = i
#     print(x+x*i)

# recursion

def recurse(x):
    if x > 100:
        return x
    else:
        print(x)
        return recurse(x+1)
recurse(1)


# def factorial(x):
#     if x == 1:
#         return x
#     else:
#         print(x)
#         return (x * factorial(x-1))
        
# num = 3

# print("the factorial of ", num, "is", factorial(num))
